## Idea
This framework will allow users to have a clear and unified view of the Risks that they should be specifically concerned about, and therefore, propose them a personalized insurance coverage.

The system uses clustering to propose a personalized risk landscape based on data from other customer choices, risk likelihood studies and claims information.

In order to request the correct questions, decisions trees could be used.
